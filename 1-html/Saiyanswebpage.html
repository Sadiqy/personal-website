		<h2>A few facts about Saiyans</h2>
		
		<img src="Saiyans.png">
		
		<p>Saiyans (サイヤ人じん Saiya-jin, lit. "People of the Saiya") are a race of extraterrestrials in the anime and manga Dragon Ball and its adaptive sequels, Dragon Ball Z, Dragon Ball GT and Dragon Ball Super. In the series, the Saiyans from Universe 7 are a naturally aggressive warrior race who were supposedly striving to be the strongest warriors in the universe, while the Saiyans from universe 6 are protectors. Nearly all of the Saiyans from Universe 7 were obliterated by Frieza before the start of the Dragon Ball series.

			The Saiyans play a central role in the series once it is revealed that the protagonist, Goku, is actually a Saiyan sent to destroy Earth
